Welcome to my blog!

This is my first post. In this blog I will share some personal thoughts about all kinds of topics, like AI, programming, technology, society, philosophy, and much more.
This blog is just a personal one with no claim of scientific correctness or any kind of personal advice. It's just about my personal views, opinions, and things that interest me or that I have experienced in my life.

If that’s said, let's get started with the topic I want to write about for now, which is **health**.

## Everybody knows that

I think everybody knows for themselves that health is one of the most important things in life, because everyone who was sick or injured once knows that your only wish during this time is to get healthy again.
You cannot do anything meaningful because your body needs rest in order to recover well, and the overall feeling is just something you want to escape as quickly as possible. It can even be life-threatening depending on the severity of the illness or injury.
Our inner survival instinct is activated in these cases and pushes all buttons and levers it can to keep our body alive.

In addition to that, society keeps telling us every day to be healthy and to take care of our health, but at the same time we see commercials for McDonald's, Coca-Cola, and other fast-food restaurants, which are full of unhealthy food and drinks.
Another point is also the entertainment industry, which wants us to sit and watch as many movies, series, or Reels/TikToks etc. as possible so they can make the most money from our time spent on these platforms.
In other words, the entertainment industry wants us to not move and sit on a couch and keep our eyes on the screens and not on the "real world."

So there is a dilemma: Our friends, family, and I think the general consensus in society want us to be healthy, but on the other hand, the capitalistic system wants us to be unhealthy indirectly in order to maximize profit, which means consuming as much as possible or staying as long as possible on a platform.
With this goal in mind, it is no wonder that this keeps getting more successful. The fast food contains substances that make us addicted to it so that we develop the inner desire to eat it again and again, even though we know that this food is really unhealthy for us.
The same happens with the famous short videos on TikTok or Instagram, which activate areas in our brain that distribute substances like dopamine and serotonin, making us addicted as well.

It is easier to get addicted and stay addicted than to never get addicted or to quit an addiction.
It is even harder because of the society we live in, where everybody in our environment is addicted as well, and we therefore think that this can't be that bad or even think that this behavior is normal.

## What not everybody knows
I think the capitalistic system we live in, which is not 100% bad or evil, and the society that this system creates, makes us believe that certain things that are bad are shifted into a positive direction so that we don't see the real problem.
And the industry does not want us to see the real problem because if we do, we are more likely to quit, and therefore they can't generate money from us anymore.

I think that certain things we think are positive or normal to us are, in fact, really bad for us, but we don't even know it.
I don't blame anyone who does not know, because even I don't know everything, and I think that I myself have certain behaviors that are not healthy for me at all — and when I don't know, I can't even change them.

If we want to follow the idea of the Enlightenment era, we must *emerge from our self-imposed immaturity*.

We can't change the whole system globally all at once to our needs so that we can be 100% healthy with no addictions at all.
But we can change ourselves and our own lives in the direction of a healthy, unhealthy, or anything-in-between life.
I know that not everybody can do this "easily" like we can in the Western world, with a lot of wealth, education, and freedom, and this is a great problem.
I wish that everybody had the opportunity to change their own life with their own hands.
But for those who can, it is a great privilege — and we can do so if we want to.

## The mission
So maybe it is the mission of the people who know to spread the word and raise awareness about the real problems in our society and the world so that others can change their lives, quit addictions, and be healthy.

Especially for those who have access to the internet and can navigate it with an open and clear mind.
The internet is a dilemma too, because there you find a lot of new addictions, but also a lot of helpful information that can help you quit the addictions and live a better life.

I think one of the most helpful resources and at the same time most inspiring persons is "Bryan Johnson."
He is a millionaire with the mission to not die.
I know that sounds hilarious, but seeing his journey, his thoughts, and as well his data is very impressive.

I can encourage everyone to watch the documentary about him and his life on Netflix or his videos on YouTube and to decide on your own with a clear and open mind what you think about it.
