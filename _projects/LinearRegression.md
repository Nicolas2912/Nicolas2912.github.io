# Linear Regression Application

A full-stack application for training and visualizing a linear regression model using C++, Node.js, and React.

## Overview
This is a full-stack application for training and visualizing a linear regression model using C++, Node.js, and React. The goal is to provide a user-friendly interface for training and visualizing linear regression models. 
With this project I wanted to enhance my skills in C++ programming as well as writing a compatible C++ backend for a web application.
